The Pros:

Lower Costs for Businesses.
For a medium-sized or small business, the cloud can save a lot of money. It means that the company does not have to purchase any local servers that can eat away into the profitability of the business. Things such as maintenance can have a huge cost implication for any business. The cloud can save many dollars for such companies.

Better Reliability.
With a cloud computing option, a dedicated group of experts handles all the maintenance. For a small company, that may not be affordable. The reason for this is that it can afford to handle may be one or two IT experts on its payroll. The result is that the performance of an in-house system can be lackluster. However, cloud-computing companies have the resources and personnel needed to ensure that the system has an uptime of at least 99%.

Cons of Cloud Computing:

It is Reliant on Internet Connectivity.
Running your business on the cloud is great as long as you have an internet connection. When your cloud-computing provider loses internet connectivity, the entire business grinds to a stop. Even the best types of cloud computing providers sometimes experience downtimes. During that time, no transactions can take place if your business is highly reliant on the cloud.

You Will Have to Seal With Recurring costs.
Cloud computing has little initial capital investment. However, an in-house server may actually make sense over time. Although you will have to incur a huge, initial cost plus IT maintenance, cloud computing will also see you stuck with a recurring monthly cost. You will have to pay this amount every month or every year if you want access to our data. The choice will depend on these factors. Weigh the costs carefully to ensure the cloud will actually help you to save money.
